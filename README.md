A Python script for adding new items to Omeka using simple YAML documents

Caleb McDaniel | <http://wcm1.web.rice.edu>

Road Map
--------

Right now this is just a barebones proof-of-concept script. Use at your own risk. To see a sample item created using this script, [click here](http://wcaleb.rice.edu/omeka/items/show/92).

Features planned:

- Command-line options for making item public, featured, part of a collection, etc.
- Add markdown processing so that markdown in the YAML will be converted to HTML before posting.
